                <h2>Course description</h2>
                <p>This is a course that will explore multimedia journalism, what it means, and how it is practiced in today's newsrooms. Specifically, we will focus on interactive packages that combine several media types to create a story that is stronger and more compelling because of it.</p>
 
                <p>There are many new and emerging technologies, but we will focus on creating packages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using these common and well-documented languages, it is possible to create everything from a fully-custom and professional multimedia package to a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsively-designed</a> web site. Of course, this course won't explore everything there is to know about these skills, but by the end of the semester you should have the tools to code and know your way around the web.</p> 
 
                <p>In addition to learning these skills, we will spend time discussing and analyzing stories from some of the leading newsrooms and media companies. We will examine how they are successful and where they can be improved.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The skills you are expected to learn include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Valid HTML/CSS layouts</li>
                    <li>Basic JavaScript</li>
                    <li>How to use open-source scripting libraries to make coding easier (and more fun)</li>
                    <li>Web usability and clear interaction design</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section">Course materials</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Required text</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</a> <br/>
                   This book is a great resource when designing for and thinking about content on the web.
                </p>
                
                <p>Sign up for a <a href="http://db.tt/VcVTZAe">Dropbox</a> account if you don't already have one. We'll use this service to share files and other resources for class. I recommend installing the Dropbox application on your computer. It's replaced my flash drive for portable file storage.</p>
                
                <p>Also, please sign up for <a href="http://codeyear.com/">Code Year</a>. It's a great way to learn how to code from scratch, even if you already have some coding knowledge. I'm doing it too.</p>
                
                <p>Because most of what we'll be exploring in this course is thoroughly documented on the web for free, I am not asking you to purchase any coding reference manuals. You'll find Google to be a great asset in your troubleshooting, and you can't quickly search a book for that specific code method you're looking for. Check out the <a href="resources/#code">resources page</a> for some good programming help sites.</p>
                
                <p>You have access to the software you will need at all times in the lab and your assignments will require that you find time to spend in the lab or on your own computer.</p>
 
                <p>You will be given some time during class, but it will NOT be possible to complete all your assignments during class, especially your final project.</p>

                <h2 class="section">Course policies</h2>
                <p>Outside of class, email will be our main avenue of communication. Please check your account on a daily basis. I will often answer your emails in the morning and evening, as I cannot guarantee that I will be able to return email during the day.</p>
 
                <p>I can also be reached on my cell phone [202-445-9948].</p>
                <!-- end course policies -->

                <h2 class="section">Attendance</h2>
                <p>Each class builds on the previous class, so attendance is paramount.  If you are unable to attend class, you may email me.  However, you will be responsible for the materials presented in class.</p>
 
                <p>Tardiness and unexcused absences will affect your grade as well as the flow of the class.  Please make all efforts to attend class and be on time. If you must miss class, you must present a doctor's note or other official documentation to excuse your absence. I will drop your lowest graded in-class assignment from your average, so you have a little cushion, but know that you will be responsible for learning the concepts covered in each class.</p>

                <h2 class="section">Homework</h2>
                <p>Each week, you will come ready to discuss a multimedia interactive of your choice. Be prepared to explain why you chose the project, why you think they are effective or why you think they are ineffective. You will judge your chosen pieces based on news value, usability and aesthetic presentation. You will also choose a part of the interactive that you would like to learn how to do.</p>
                <p><a href="resources/#multimedia">Here are some good resources for finding new and interesting visual journalism.</a></p>
                <p>Also, we will be working through <a href="http://www.codeyear.com">Code Year</a> courses during the semester. Be prepared to show your progress and talk about what exercises challenged you.</p>

                <p><strong>Design critique</strong>: Select an multimedia package online to review and analyze. You will write a critical analysis of the project, explaining what the project does well and where its shortcomings lie. The paper should take into account information architecture, usability and overall design, as well as any bugs or programming flaws you might find.</p>
                <p>Please cite Krug or any other sources you use to examine the project and back up your conclusions.</p>
                <p>The paper should be double-spaced; undergrad students should write between 5-6 pages; graduate students should write between 7-8 pages.</p>
                <p><strong>Due date March 15.</strong></p>

                <p>For graduate students: In addition to the longer written assignment and final project paper, you will be required to give a talk during a predetermined class about a subject related to the course. This talk will account for 5% of your class assignments grade.</p>

                <p>I will post notes to this web site to notify you of any class time or assignment changes due to blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other disasters. When in doubt, please check this page before setting out. In addition, the university website posts notices about campus closings.</p>
                
                <h2 class="section">Standards, ethics and academic integrity</h2>
                <p>Students are expected to adhere to the strictest journalistic and academic standards. You must do all work yourself. Along with certain rights, students also have the responsibility to behave honorably in an academic environment. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty and plagiarism (including use of unauthorized photos, graphics, text or layout/templates from the Web) will not be tolerated. Any abridgement of academic integrity standards will be referred directly to the campus judiciary. Confirmation of such incidents could result in the earning of an "XF" grade for the course and may result in more severe consequences, such as expulsion. Students who are uncertain as to what constitutes academic dishonesty should consult the university publication called "Code of Academic Integrity," administered by the Student Honor Council. This code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland for all undergraduate and graduate students.  For more information on the code or the council, please visit <a href="http://www.studenthonorcouncil.umd.edu/whatis.html">http://www.studenthonorcouncil.umd.edu/whatis.html</a>.</p>
