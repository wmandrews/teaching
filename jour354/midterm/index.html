                <h2>Midterm Project</h2>

                <p><span class="red">Due in your Dropbox "Midterm" folder before class starts on April 5.</span></p>
                
                <p>Create an interactive slideshow with dynamically loaded data, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your presentation should be well designed and easy to use, utilizing concepts we've discussed in class and in the reading.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>HTML/CSS</strong></h4>
                <p>The HTML and CSS should be laid out in a properly spaced format, with id's and classes being used to style the page elements. You should include comments in your code to note the different sections of your layout, along with any other comments you need. Don't forget title, keywords and a description in your page head.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>JavaScript</strong></h4>
                <p>The JavaScript should be clean and easy to read, and should work without bugs. The data that powers the slideshow (images, captions, etc.) should be stored in an external file, and dynamically loaded using methods learned in class. Include comments to explain what each chunk of code is supposed to do. The slideshow should have a logical navigation that is powered by JavaScript. The navigation style is up to you. I'd recommend using a lot of jQuery.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Subject</strong></h4>                
                <p>The subject is up to you. However, you should treat the story as if you were publishing on a news website. I don't mind if you use only third-party sources on the internet since this isn't a reporting class, but please do not just rip everything from Wikipedia. You're in journalism school, so you should be able to write your own captions.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Page elements</strong></h4>
                <p>The page should include a title and some explanatory text, along with sourcing and credits for the information and images that you use. Beyond that, the design is up to you as long as you include some sort of image slideshow. Feel free to include other elements as you see fit.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Organization</strong></h4>
                <p>Make sure you organize your files in a logical way, including folders when necessary. Name your main html file "index.html" and drop everything in your Dropbox "Midterm" folder. Make sure the folder structure on Dropbox matches the folder structure of your project folder so that all the file references are correct. It is probably easiest to zip your project folder and upload it.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Written description</strong></h4>
                <p>Please write a one page, double-spaced description of your project, including why you made the design and code choices that you did. Print it out and bring to class the day the midterm is due, or drop a .doc file in your midterm folder on Dropbox.</p>

                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <p>Here are some examples of interactive slideshows to get you started. However, <em>be original</em>. Extra points for original presentations. Really think about what you like and don't like about slideshows, and try to make it better.</p>
