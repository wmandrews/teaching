                <h2>Final Project</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="red">Due in your Dropbox "Final" folder before Thursday, May 17 at 7:15 p.m.</span><br/>
                    You must also email me a url where your project has been successfully published, on your Terp Connect drive or elsewhere on the www.<br/>
                    Late projects <strong>will not</strong> be accepted. This is a deadline-driven field.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Main goal</strong></h4>
                <p>Create a multimedia project that effectively tells a story that is relevant to the local area. The local area could be the college community, College Park, the DC metro area or even the state of Maryland.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Content</strong></h4>
                <p>You will need to report and gather the content for this project. If you use video, photos or graphics that weren't created by you, make sure you have the permission of the creator to use in your project. The project should undergo all the necessary steps that you would follow to publish something on a media company's site. You will be rewarded the more you use original content in your project.</p>
                
                <p>There is no set amount of video, text, photo or other element that you need to include, but your project must tell a compelling story using methods and techniques we've covered in this class. A sample project might have a main story page with a slideshow, some text and a graphic, along with additional pages that cover other parts of the story using more elements.</p>
                
                <p>Please <span class="red">run your story idea by me</span> before you do too much work on it. I can help give you ideas about  types of content and can provide some resources that might make your reporting, data gathering and coding easier.</p>
                
                <p>The point is, <strong>use the tools you've learned to make a story better than if it were just a text-based article</strong>.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>HTML/CSS</strong></h4>
                <p>The HTML and CSS should be laid out in a properly spaced format, with id's and classes being used to style the page elements. You should include comments in your code to note the different sections of your layout, along with any other comments you need to help you make your layout clear. The project should have a logical navigation. Don't forget title, keywords and a description in your page headers.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>JavaScript</strong></h4>
                <p>The JavaScript should be clean and easy to read, and should work without bugs. If it makes sense to load your data dynamically (does it change? is it a lot of data or media?), then you should use JavaScript. Otherwise, writing content directly in your HTML is fine. Include comments to explain what each chunk of code is supposed to do.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Organization</strong></h4>
                <p>Make sure you organize your files in a logical way, according to <a href="../week10">the concepts</a> we covered in class.</p>
                <h4><strong>Written description</strong></h4>
                <p>Please write a 1-2 paper that outlines the goals of the project and quickly summarizes the thought process behind your approach. JOUR 654 students will be required to write it as a 3 page paper about the project, in what is essentially a short critique of the work. Please include this file in the Dropbox folder when you turn in your project.</p>

                    <h3>Local story ideas</h3>
                    <p>A few ideas that might help you think of your own stories.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A guide to the Cherry Blossom Festival, including an event calendar, slideshow, and interactive map.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A profile of a local music venue or sports program (sports might be difficult to do much original reporting on).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An interactive game to tell a story. <a href="http://reesenews.org/2010/12/16/staying-in-bounds/7929/">A good example of using a game to tell a story in a new way</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A resource of information for local government information and officials (profiles, publicly-available salaries, etc.).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A report on local restaurants and health codes (remember <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/dining/new-york-health-department-restaurant-ratings-map.html">this</a>?). You could do a simple sortable table with the data, or use something like <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/public/tour/index.html">Google Fusion Tables</a> to create a map and table automatically.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An interactive timeline. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <p>Here are some additional examples of multimedia projects and code that you can draw inspiration from.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/bell/">Some really good data-heavy multimedia here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/examples/quick-start.html">Interactive maps</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/libya-uprising/">Map-based timeline</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/issues#issue/abortion">Tab-based story</a><br/>Good as a single element, would probably need more than just this for your full project.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
