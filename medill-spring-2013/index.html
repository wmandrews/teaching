            <h2>Our focus</h2>
            <p>Data has never been as plentiful, and important, in human history. It shapes business decisions and government policies, but understanding data and visualizing it clearly and without bias is still rare.</p>
            <p>When properly produced, data visualization and graphic analysis can be a most-effective storytelling technique. Our goal is to understand when and why to use visuals to tell a story, and how to shape data into appropriate and powerful visual storytelling.</p>
            
            <h3>Classwork</h3>
            <p>Each class we'll get our hands dirty with data, in either a more abstract sense, or by creating something very specific and literal. Every week we'll build on previous work, and classroom discussion will be crucial to achieving great work. For these reasons, attendance is of utmost importance in this class.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-error">For each class:</strong> Please add to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar3tE0gJ38POdElLeDBJYmNEM3hJUzJFc0F3bUZRSkE#gid=0">this list</a> a link of a graphic or visual storytelling that was recently published that you'd like to discuss at the beginning of class. Even more interesting might be a story that uses data, but doesn't make use of visuals to illustrate its point; if you choose this option, please create a simple sketch of a graphic that could have been used to more effectively tell the story.</p>
            
            <h3>Homework</h3>
            <p>Often I will ask you to submit work that we've started or discussed in class so I can see how you're progressing during the quarter. This work won't be graded, but it will be important to show the concepts that you're handling or having a hard time with so I can help tailor the lessons and exercises to push us forward.</p>
            
            <h3>Final project</h3>
            <p>The majority of work you do for this course will be on your final project. You should begin thinking about your final project subject now.</p>
            <p>Your project should be a story that is relevant to the District of Columbia. Whether you take a look at a social issue, business, local government, transportation, federal workers, sports, public policy...there are a wealth of stories to tell about this city, many that are seldom or never told.</p>
            <p>Your project should include original data reporting, analysis and visuals. The project will be published on the web to finish the quarter, but the work doesn't have to meet a certain level of interactivity. More importantly, you'll be graded on the news value, choice and quality of visuals, and the effectiveness of your data and graphics at telling a story. If your visuals include web interactivity that is smart and effective, you will be rewarded, but the most important trait of your project is effective visual storytelling.</p>
            <p>The deadline for choosing your final project story is <span class="label label-info" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.2em;">May 2.</span> After I have approved your story idea, you should submit a somewhat formal, but short memo about your story idea. You I will meet with each of you in class that day to briefly discuss your idea and make sure you have a good plan for completing it thoroughly and on time. Of course, I encourage you to communicate your story ideas with me before that date, so that you can be sure you have selected a story with good potential by the deadline.</p>
            <h4 class="text-error">The final project is due at the beginning of the last class, June 11.</h4>
            <p>You will give a short presentation showing off your work to the class, explaining your process behind the story.</p>
